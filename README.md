# MemoryCardGame

INTRODUCTION
A memory card game is a board game which is puzzle type.
To win you must find all the pairs.
Playing memory games can improve other brain functions,
such as attention, concentration, and focus.
Memory games can improve visual recognition too.

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
In the course of my work, I wanted to make a game that is available on a
website because the most important element of this game is
visibility and location of images.
